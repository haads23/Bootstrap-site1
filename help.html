                    <p class="card-text">The coal industry stands in the way of a safe and healthy future for us all. From destructive mines to polluting stacks and toxic ash dumps, coal lays waste to our environment. Coal threatens our most basic needs: clean water to drink, clean air to breathe, and a safe climate.<br>
                    <br>Coal is a dying industry, and for good reason. Emissions from burning coal for heat and energy fuel global warming, making coal the single greatest threat to our climate. Coal mining is also a source of methane, a very potent global warming gas.<br>
                    <br>Open-cut coal mining disturbs landscapes on a vast scale, destroying forests and scraping away soils. So severe is the damage, in most cases it cannot be repaired. <br>
                    <br>When mines unearth and disturb rock and earth, toxic chemicals within can mix with water. This leads to acid main drainage, harmful to streams, soils, and plants, animals and people.<br>
                    <br>Unfortunately, there are no ways we can stop mining but still produce it to the world. However, we can prevent it from getting out-of-hand, wasteful or harming animals and the environment. Here are some ways we can stop the impact of mining.<br>
                    <br>Clear up after deserted and used mines, preventing animal species from consuming dangerous chemicals.<br>
                      <br>Not wasting tonnes of earth dug out from where mining has taken place. This can be where animals are living.|<br> 
                      <br>Enforcing more serious mining regulations and laws to reduce mining and make sure that it is not done where there are endangered animals.

·        Reduce the consumer goods we use or minerals in a manufactured process.

·        Use recycled materials. It takes far less energy and is cheaper, to recycle discarded materials then to take them. It takes 95% less energy to produce some recycled materials rather than from the ore. Recycling can take 7 times less energy than processing ore. Recycling steel uses three and a half times less.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Traditional power grids are centralized, which can create inefficiencies in energy distribution, like having unused surplus. And in parts of the world affected by natural disasters or poverty, power outages can leave people without access to electricity.<br>

                    <br>A peer to peer blockchain based energy system system would reduce the need to transmit electricity over long distances, which can result in losses along the way. It would also help reduce the need for energy storage, because such trading can move electricity locally from where it’s being produced in excess to where it’s needed.<br>
                    
                    <br>Transactive Grid is a joint venture between ConsenSys and LO3 Energy that is working on a blockchain platform that solves this problem.<br>

                    <br>SunContract is a blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading platform for solar and other renewables.<br>  

                    <br>Power plant installations are expensive and are often financed by governments of large private companies.<br>

                    <br>A blockchain-based platform could enable institutions, companies, and individuals to get returns from directly investing in renewable energy installations in their area and around the world.<br>

                    <br>EcoChain is a blockchain dApp being developed, which aims to do just that – create a platform for people to invest in renewables and get a return on their investment.<br>

                    <br>ElectricChain is another blockchain platform with several apps like SolarCoin, which aims to incentivize solar installations around the world.<br></p>

                <div class="card-block">
                    <h3 class="card-title" align="center">3.Recycling </h3>
                    <p class="card-text">With the current recycling programs, people often don’t have good incentives to participate. The responsibility for running recycling programs often falls on each separate city, which results in many places not having recycling programs at all. It’s also difficult to track and compare the impact of these programs.

                    A recycling program on the blockchain could encourage participation by giving a financial reward in the form of a cryptographic token in exchange for depositing recyclables like plastic containers, cans, or bottles.<br>
                    
                    <br>Social Plastic (aka Plastic Bank) is a project that is turning plastic into currency by setting up collection centers in third world countries, where people can deposit used plastic in exchange for currency, services like phone charging, or items like cooking fuel. <br>
                    <br>They aim to clean up the world from plastic waste while alleviating poverty. They are now working on a blockchain-powered app that will allow people to exchange plastic for cryptographic tokens.<br>
                    <br>RecycleToCoin is another blockchain dApp in development that will enable people to return their used plastic containers in exchange for a token, through automated machines in Europe and around the world.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">In the current system, the environmental impact of each product is difficult to determine, and its carbon footprint is not factored into the price. This means that there is little incentive for consumers to buy products with a low carbon footprint, and little incentive for companies to sell such products.<br>

                    <br>Tracking the carbon footprint of each product using the blockchain would protect this data from tampering, and it can be used to determine the amount of carbon tax to be charged on at the point of sale. If a product with a large carbon footprint is more expensive to buy, this would encourage buyers to buy products that are more environmentally friendly, and would therefore encourage companies to restructure their supply chains to meet the demand for such products.<br>

                    <br>A blockchain-based reputation system could also give each company and product a score based on the carbon footprint of the products they sell. This would make manufacturing more transparent, and discourage wasteful and environmentally unfriendly practices.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Every year, 33 million acres of forests are cut down. Timber harvesting in the tropics alone contributes 1.5 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere. That represents 20 percent of human-made greenhouse gas emissions and a source that could be avoided relatively easily.<br>

                    <br>Improved agricultural practices along with paper recycling and forest management—balancing the amount of wood taken out with the amount of new trees growing—could quickly eliminate this significant chunk of emissions.<br>

                    <br>And when purchasing wood products, such as furniture or flooring, buy used goods or, failing that, wood certified to have been sustainably harvested. The Amazon and other forests are not just the lungs of the earth, they may also be humanity's best short-term hope for limiting climate change.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Most people want to buy products that are ethically made, but that kind of information is often unavailable and difficult to verify. A product goes through many hands before it reaches the store. It’s very easy for companies to lie about how their products are made, what materials and chemicals they use, where they dump1 their garbage, or how fairly they treat their employees.<br>

                    <br>Blockchains can be used to track products from the manufacturer to the shelf and help prevent waste, inefficiency, fraud, and unethical practices by making supply chains more transparent. They can also help consumers be better informed of how each product was made and shipped so they can make more environmentally friendly choices.<br>

                    <br>If we tracked food, for example, this would enable buyers to purchase local produce knowing that it was actually grown locally. This would also cut down on carbon emissions due to food not having to travel long distances. Blockchains could ensure that a fish being sold at a fish market actually came from a sustainable fisherman, or verify that a bag of coffee really came from a fair trade producer.<br>

                    <br>Foodtrax is a blockchain-powered dApp being made by the Blockchain Development Company, and it aims to do just that – track food from its origin to the store shelf.<br>

                   <br> Provenace is another blockchain project that aims to make supply chains more transparent.</p>
